This equation describes the maximum angle between two x-rays leaving
an interaction area of 0.5mm radius and impinging on a detector 
with radius 1.38mm at a distance Xcm.
The interaction area is stationary, and the detector pointing towards
the center of the interaction area, with an angle Y.

atan((-sin(Y+0.138/x)*x - 0.05)/(cos(Y+0.138/x)*x)) + atan((-sin(Y-0.138/x)*x + 0.05)/(cos(Y-0.138/x)*x))



This equation shows the amount of energy deposited by a gamma photon
of energy E through compton scattering at an angle of Y
E(1 - 510e3/(E*(1-cos(Y)) + 510e3))
